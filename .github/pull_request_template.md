**Checklist**
- [ ] My `recipe.yaml` file specifies which version(s) of MAX is compatible with my project (see [here](https://github.com/modular/modular-community/blob/main/recipes/endia/recipe.yaml) for an example). If not, my package is compatible with both 24.5 and 24.6.
- [ ] License file is packaged (see [here](https://github.com/modular/modular-community/blob/dbe0200598733fea411ee2246507705e8ea07a32/recipes/hue/recipe.yaml#L33-L40) for an example).
- [ ] Set the build number to `0` (for new packages, or if the version changed).
- [ ] Bumped the build number (if the version is unchanged).
